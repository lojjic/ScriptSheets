		<p>In the 13th day of the ground campaign, coalition forces are moving closer to Baghdad, said Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal. The Baghdad Division in Kut and the Medina Division of the Republican Guard, he said, are no longer "credible forces."</p>
		<p>At the same time, both McChrystal and Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke stressed that the most difficult battles may yet unfold.</p>
		<p>"As much as we are making good progress -- and we are -- the toughest fighting could lie ahead," Clarke said. "The likelihood that they might use chemical weapons is in front of us now. We are not underestimating how tough it could be going forward."</p>
		<p>U.S. ground forces closed in on multiple fronts south of Baghdad Wednesday after battling Republican Guard troops protecting key routes to the Iraqi capital, military officials said.</p>
		<p>The U.S. Army's 3rd Infantry Division was pushing north after seizing the city of Karbala, while Marines moved up from Kut and coalition warplanes were pounding Iraqi positions in northern Iraq, where Kurdish fighters were reporting gains.</p>
		<p>Elements of the 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry -- the lead force of the 3rd Infantry -- had advanced to within 25 miles of Baghdad, reported CNN's Walter Rodgers, who is embedded with the unit. That report was cleared by 7th Cavalry officials. (On the scene)</p>
		<p>Soldiers from the 3rd Infantry Division fought and defeated troops from the Republican Guard's Medina Division earlier Wednesday at Karbala, about 50 miles south of Baghdad, U.S. Army officers said. (Map of battle areas)</p>
		<p>Apache helicopter gunships from the U.S. Army's V Corps, 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment, were able to fly past Karbala and within striking distance of southern Baghdad late Wednesday.</p>
		<p>"It's a very quick-moving, very fluid battle," said pilot Capt. Brian McCort. "The armor and mechanized infantry and artillery pieces on the ground are moving at rapid speeds."</p>
		<p>The 3rd Infantry's 1st and 3rd Brigades took Karbala with little effort, Army sources told Rodgers. The 1st Brigade faced only a few tanks and some mortars as it moved through town. The 3rd Brigade came in behind the 1st to secure the city. </p>

		<p>A statement attributed to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was read on Iraqi television Wednesday, urging Iraqis to defend their towns. Saddam did not appear.</p>
		<p>"Victory is at hand, God willing, although we have only utilized a third or less of our army while the criminals have used everything they brought in," a statement read by an Iraqi television announcer said. "Their failure was manifested and victory is glowing, God willing."</p>
		<p>POW rescued; bodies found</p>
		<p>U.S. forces launched a pre-dawn raid Wednesday to rescue an Army prisoner of war, who was being held at a Nasiriya hospital used as an Iraqi military post.</p>
		<p>Pentagon officials confirmed the rescue of Pfc. Jessica Lynch, 19, who had been listed as missing in action after intense fighting near Nasiriya on March 23. (Full story)</p>
		<p>"It was just wonderful news," her brother, Greg Lynch Jr., said. "After we received a call, my mom literally about tore the front door off the house. The town, the fire trucks came up the road to celebrate. Friends, family from the community was here. It was a madhouse."</p>
		<p>Lynch, a supply clerk with the 507th Maintenance Company from Fort Bliss, Texas, suffered multiple gunshot wounds in the ambush that led to her capture and had to be moved from the hospital with special care, Pentagon sources said. (What happened to the 507th?)</p>
		<p>Lynch was being transferred to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, where she was expected to arrive about 4 p.m. EST Wednesday, a U.S. Air Force spokesman said.</p>
		<p>Central Command said 11 bodies also were discovered at the Nasiriya hospital. It's not clear if the bodies are those of U.S. soldiers. The military is trying to identify the bodies. 	</p>

		<p>LANGLEY, VA—The CIA announced Monday that it suspects Saddam Hussein's latest televised address was pre-recorded, pointing to its suspiciously dated reference to Nelly's "Hot In Herre," a rap hit from the summer of 2002.</p>
		<p>Above: In a message believed to be pre-taped, Saddam warns the U.S. about rising heat levels in Iraq.</p>
		<p>"For the enemy invaders of Iraq, it soon will get truly hot in here," Hussein said in the speech, which was televised worldwide Monday. "No amount of clothing removal will be sufficient to withstand the fiery inferno that awaits them on the battlefield."</p>
		<p>Many U.S. officials have speculated that Saddam may have been killed or injured in the initial March 19 air attacks on Baghdad, suggesting that his subsequent televised speeches were recorded weeks or even months ago.</p>
		<p>"The 'hot in here' line has definitely raised some eyebrows," CIA director George Tenet said. "However, this may not prove anything: Even though that song is nine months old, you still hear people referencing its chorus all the time. It's even in the new Chris Rock movie."</p>
