<h1>ScriptSheet.js Documentation</h1>

<h2>What It Does:</h2>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allow for a highly elegant separation of content and presentation; you can specify multiple alternate style sheets to switch between, and even turn off all styles altogether. However, CSS is limited in the complexity of style it can handle; it can't can't manipulate the DOM, perform complex logic or calculations, or provide a high level of user interaction.</p>
<p>JavaScript in current-day browsers, however, has none of these limitations. But there is currently no standardized<strong>*</strong> mechanism for applying scripts as an independent presentation layer. The ScriptSheet framework is such a layer; it allows scripts to be used to style elements in complex ways, and perhaps more importantly for those same styles to be completely removed, allowing style switching. A page author can specify alternate ScriptSheet styles in the same manner he would specify alternate CSS styles.</p>
<p>Also included is a StyleChooser widget, which dynamically creates a selection field that allows the user to choose between alternate styles. The user's selection can be remembered between visits.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong><em>MSIE and Mozilla both have their proprietary technologies: MSIE has <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/properties/behavior_1.asp">behaviors</a> and Mozilla has <a href="http://mozilla.org/projects/xbl/xbl.html"><acronym title="eXtensible Binding Language">XBL</acronym></a>, but neither are standardized or work in other browsers. Therefore they are not viable options for cross-browser development.</em></p>


<h2>How To Use It:</h2>

<h3>Applying a ScriptSheet to an HTML document:</h3>
<p>There are two steps required to apply a ScriptSheet script to an HTML document:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Use a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element to import the external .js file containing the ScriptSheet script. This just makes the browser load and parse the script; the script isn't actually run yet.</li>
	<li>Use a <code>&lt;link rel="scriptsheet"&gt;</code> element to specify how the ScriptSheet is applied to the document. This follows the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/present/styles.html#h-14.3.1">rules for applying CSS stylesheets to HTML documents</a>, particularly in regards to specifying alternate styles with the <code>title</code> attribute. Since a JavaScript function does not have its own URL, use <samp>path/to/scriptfile.js#FunctionName</samp> for the <code>href</code> to specify the ScriptSheet function to apply. An example:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>&lt;html>
  &lt;head>
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="TheScript.js">&lt;/script>
    &lt;link rel="scriptsheet" type="text/javascript" 
      href="TheScript.js#TheScript" title="Name of the Style" />
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    ...
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></code></pre>


<h3>Using the StyleChooser widget:</h3>
<pre><code>var chooser = new StyleChooser();
chooser.appendTo(parentElement); //or:
chooser.insertBefore(siblingElement);</code></pre>
<p>This StyleChooser is similar to other widgets, except that it is designed to work with the ScriptSheet framework in addition to CSS stylesheets. You can use multiple StyleChooser widgets within a single document; a change in one will update the selection of the others.</p>

<h3>Creating your own ScriptSheet script:</h3>
<p>On the most basic level, a ScriptSheet is simply a Function object (JavaScript's version of a Class) with three characteristics:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Its constructor takes an Element node reference as its first (and probably only) argument, and when instantiated it performs all the styling and DOM manipulation on that Element.</li>
	<li>It gives each of its instances a <code>destroy()</code> method which undoes everything that was done when the instance was created. This allows side-effect-free unassigning of the style and switching between styles.</li>
	<li>It has a <code>scriptSheetSelector</code> property which is set to a CSS selector string describing which elements to apply the style to (see the CSS selectors spec for details). The following selectors are supported: universal, element, id, class, attribute, descendant, child, and following-sibling selectors, and the comma separator for specifying multiple selectors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a simple example of a complete ScriptSheet script that shows any element with a "duplicate-me" class twice:</p>
<pre><code>function Duplicated(elt) {
  this.element = elt;
  this.create();
}
Duplicated.prototype = {
  create : function() {  //apply the style:
    this.dupe = this.element.cloneNode(true);
    this.element.parentNode.insertBefore(this.dupe, this.element);
  },
  destroy : function() {  //undo everything:
    this.element.parentNode.removeChild(this.dupe);
	this.dupe = this.element = null;
  }
};
Duplicated.scriptSheetSelector = ".duplicate-me";</code></pre>


<h2>What It Depends On:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>IEtoW3C.js or IEtoW3C-loader.js (required for MSIE) - used to make MSIE understand DOM2 Events methods</li>
	<li>Cookie.js (optional) - allows the script to remember the chosen style between visits</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compatibility:</h2>
<p>Known to work in Mozilla (and derivatives) on any platform and MSIE 5.0+ on Windows.</p>

<h2>Demonstration:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="ScriptSheet-test.html">ScriptSheet-test.html</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>To Do:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Add support for additional browser platforms such as KHTML/Safari and Opera.</li>
	<li>Add support for additional selectors.</li>
	<li>Remove dependency on Cookie.js since we don't need all its advanced capability.</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>Known Issues:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Not all specifics of CSS selectors are supported, such as comments, escaped strings, and pseudoclasses/pseudoelements. See above for which selectors are supported.</li>
</ul>
