=======================================
== TODO List for the Script Library: ==
=======================================


* When/if it is standardized, create XBL versions of each.  This will facilitate the above, and allow hooking-up of elements if they are created after the initial module instantiation.

* Unify and improve error reporting

* Add dependency list to each module (OSXBar requires PopupObject, etc.)




==== DONE: ====

* Create minimal loader for IEtoW3C.js so compliant browsers don't have to load it
* Create cookie-handling class
* Create module that allows usage of "script styles" like stylesheets, and switching between them
	- Will involve adding the capability for each module to remove everything it's done
